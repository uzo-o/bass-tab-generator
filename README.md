<br/>creates 4-string bass tabs based on user input or randomized string and fret values

## Description
When making plain-text bass tabs for personal use, I found it bothersome trying to
maintain the formatting. With this 4-string bass tab generator, the user specifies
which strings and frets they would like to add and can view the printed results.
As opposed to traditional bass tabs, the strings are oriented vertically, essentially
Guitar Hero style. The user can also generate a tab of random notes for fun. The
easiest way to play while reading would be to paste the output into a text editor
with auto-scroll.
