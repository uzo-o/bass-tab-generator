# Bass Tab Generator
creates 4-string bass tabs based on user input file

## Description
When making plain-text bass tabs for personal use, I found it bothersome trying to
maintain the formatting (ex. copying and pasting strings, keeping numbers aligned).
With this 4-string bass tab generator, the user can simply list the strings and
frets they would like to add to their tab via a text file and then view the
formatted results.
